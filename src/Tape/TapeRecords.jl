# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Tape records for the CS adjoint reverse loop.
#
# Each forward-recorded operation pushes one record type onto the tape;
# the reverse-loop driver in `src/Footprint/ReverseLoop.jl` (post-P0.3;
# currently still in Adjoints.jl) dispatches on these record types and
# calls the appropriate per-physics adjoint kernel.
#
# Notes on the scheme parameter:
#
# The record type parameter `S` is intentionally unconstrained in this
# module. The `CSAdjointSupportedScheme` union that enumerates the
# concrete scheme types with adjoint kernels lives in `src/Adjoints/`
# and is enforced at the **construction call sites** (`_record_sweep!`
# in Footprint) and the **kernel dispatch** (`_adjoint_scheme_sweep!`
# in Adjoints). Keeping `_CSSweepRecord` parametric on `S::Any` here
# avoids a circular dependency between `Tape` (which would otherwise
# need to import the union from `Adjoints`) and `Adjoints` (which
# constructs these records).
#
# `_CSLinRoodHorizRecord` is defined separately in
# `src/Adjoints/LinRoodTape.jl` (Plan 25 Commit 6 baseline) and is
# **not** part of the `_CSTapeOp` union below. The reverse-loop driver
# handles it via an explicit branch alongside the union dispatch.
#
# Code relocated from `src/Adjoints/Adjoints.jl` lines 2567-2604
# unchanged in Plan 26 P0.1; no semantic change.

    _CSSweepRecord{FT, T, R, F3, S}

Forward-recorded per-direction advection sweep. `direction ∈ (:x, :y, :z)`,
`scheme` is the advection scheme used, `panels_m` / `panels_rm` are the
staged air-mass / tracer-mass tape slots (the latter is `nothing` for
linear schemes that don't need a tracer tape), `panels_flux` is the
per-panel face-flux tuple, `flux_scale` is the scaling applied during
the subcycle.

Forward-recorded cross-panel halo fill (`dir ∈ (0, 1, 2)`: full / X-only / Y-only).

Forward-recorded implicit vertical-diffusion application. `op` is the

operator's workspace at this step, `panels_m` is the air-mass tape slot,
`dt` is the (half-)timestep size.
