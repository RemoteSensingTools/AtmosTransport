# Transport-binary format assembly: typed metadata, contracts, readers,
# writers, and inspection share the `MetDrivers` namespace.
#
# Include order is dependency-driven (types must be defined before the methods
# that dispatch on them at include time):
#   header  →  contract  →  reader  →  cubed-sphere reader specializations
#           →  payload sections  →  writer  →  streaming writer
#           →  cubed-sphere writer  →  inspect
# Function bodies may call across files freely; only type and constant
# definitions constrain include order.
