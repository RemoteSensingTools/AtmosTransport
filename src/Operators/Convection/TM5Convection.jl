    TM5Convection(; tile_workspace_gib=1.0, use_collab_lu=false,
                    lmax_conv=0, n_merge=1)

TM5-style convective transport operator. Four-field mass-flux scheme
following Tiedtke (1989) as implemented in TM5-4DVAR: two entrainment
and two detrainment fields (updraft + downdraft). The backward-Euler
transport matrix `conv1 = I - dt·D` is dense within the cloud window
and identity above; the solver assembles and factorizes only the active
lower-right cloud block. The legacy workspace retains its pivot vector for
supported adjoint replay; collaborative factors live only in shared memory.

`use_collab_lu` selects the workgroup-collaborative solver. `lmax_conv=0`
uses all vertical levels; a positive value limits the active lower atmosphere.
`n_merge` optionally aggregates adjacent active layers before the solve.
Float32 GPU matrices support effective depths 1..85. Float64 CUDA supports
unmerged (`n_merge=1`) depths 1..73, using Float64 shared arrays and arithmetic.
CPU and unsupported Float64 configurations retain the legacy solver with a
warning. Tracers use batches of six; total tracer count does not set this depth
limit. Defaults remain the full-column legacy solve. CS adjoint footprints
still require the full-column, unmerged legacy variant.

The forcing arrays `(entu, detu, entd, detd)` arrive via
`TransportModel.convection_forcing.tm5_fields`, populated each
substep by `DrivenSimulation._refresh_forcing!` from
`sim.window.convection`.

# Memory budget

`tile_workspace_gib` (binary GiB) is the per-topology target for
the TM5 column-tile workspace.
`_convection_workspace_for(::TM5Convection, ...)` reads this field
and derives a tile size `B` via [`derive_tile_columns`](@ref); the
[`TM5Workspace`](@ref) uses a single `(Nz, Nz, B)` matrix slab plus
matching pivot, cloud-dimension, and flux-vector slabs. A larger budget
means fewer legacy kernel launches at the cost of more memory.
When collaborative LU is requested, global scratch is deferred because
the kernels use shared memory. Unsupported configurations allocate the configured
tile on first use and reuse it. The default legacy budget is 1.0 GiB.

# Basis convention

`TM5Convection` is **basis-polymorphic**, identical to
[`CMFMCConvection`](@ref). The four forcing fields
must be on the same basis as `state.air_mass` (moist by upstream
Fortran convention and by the ec2tm preprocessor default; dry
requires a sibling preprocessor path).

# Fields required on `ConvectionForcing`

- `forcing.tm5_fields :: NamedTuple{(:entu, :detu, :entd, :detd)}`
  with all four arrays at layer centers in AtmosTransport
  orientation (k=1=TOA, k=Nz=surface). Units kg / m² / s.
  Shapes per topology:
  - Structured LatLon: `(Nx, Ny, Nz)` per field.
  - Face-indexed ReducedGaussian: `(ncells, Nz)` per field.
  - Panel-native CubedSphere: `NTuple{6, AbstractArray{FT, 3}}`
    per field, with per-panel shape `(Nc, Nc, Nz)`.

Orientation conversion + sign flip on `entd` happen in the preprocessor
(`src/Preprocessing/tm5_convection_conversion.jl`). The operator performs
zero runtime orientation gymnastics.

# Solver class

Partial-pivot Gaussian elimination on the active lower-right block per
column (see `test/test_tm5_sparsity_above_icltop.jl` for the structure
survey).
Identity rows above the effective cloud top and the lower-left zero
quadrant are skipped by both the factorization and the tracer solve.

Pivoting is kept even though the matrix is diagonally dominant by
construction (upstream Fortran comment says pivoting "not needed").
The pivot vector is stored in [`TM5Workspace`](@ref) so the adjoint
can replay the same factorization with `trans='T'`.

# CFL sub-cycling

None. The backward-Euler matrix solve is unconditionally stable
for any `dt`, unlike `CMFMCConvection`'s forward-Euler two-pass
update which requires sub-cycling when the CMFMC profile is
strong. The kernel launches once per tile and calls
`synchronize(backend)` once per `apply!`.
