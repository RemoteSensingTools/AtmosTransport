# # Tutorial: synthetic lat-lon end-to-end
#
# This tutorial builds a tiny synthetic transport binary locally,
# loads it with the runtime driver, runs a couple of advection steps,
# and checks mass conservation — all without any external met data.
# Everything here uses public API; the same pattern underlies
# `test/core/test_driven_simulation.jl`.
#
# Use this as a template when you want to:
#
# - smoke-test the runtime on a fresh install,
# - explore the data flow (binary → driver → state → simulation),
# - build a custom synthetic case for a unit test.
#
# Run the source directly from the repository root with
# `julia --project=. docs/literate/synthetic_latlon.jl`, or read the executed
# version in the documentation site.

# ## 1. Build a tiny synthetic binary locally
#
# We assemble two windows on an 8 × 4 × 2 lat-lon grid. A small constant
# eastward mass flux is periodic and divergence-free: it moves a tracer blob
# while total air mass and conservative tracer storage remain constant.

# ## What's next
#
# - Change the synthetic fluxes or initial blob and inspect how transport
#   responds while the two conservation assertions remain satisfied.
# - Swap `UpwindScheme()` for `SlopesScheme()` or `PPMScheme()` to
#   see scheme-dependent behavior on the same forcing.
# - Add another tracer with its own initial pattern and compare how both
#   conservative storage fields move through the same air-mass fluxes.
# - Swap the synthetic binary for a real preprocessed ERA5 day
#   produced by `scripts/preprocessing/preprocess_transport_binary.jl`
#   and the same code structure runs against real meteorology.
