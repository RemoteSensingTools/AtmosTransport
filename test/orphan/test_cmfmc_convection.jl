# Plan 18 Commit 3 — CMFMCConvection
#
# Test coverage per plan 18 v5.1 §3 Commit 3 (three-tier validation):
#
# Tier A (analytic / structural) — required, always run:
#   A1. Mass conservation: column total tracer mass preserved to
#       machine precision (no positivity clamp, linear operator).
#   A2. Zero-forcing identity: cmfmc = dtrain = 0 leaves state
#       bit-exact unchanged.
#   A3. Uniform-q invariance: constant mixing ratio input → constant
#       output under arbitrary forcing (linearity + mass balance).
#   A4. Sub-cycling bit-exactness (Decision 21): one apply!(dt) with
#       cached n_sub equals n_sub manual apply!(dt / n_sub) calls to
#       machine precision.
#   A5. Adjoint identity (Decision 11 + adjoint addendum §A):
#       ⟨y, L·x⟩ ≈ ⟨L^T·y, x⟩ verifies the forward operator is
#       linear in q. Kernel has no positivity clamp (§D).
#   A6. Face-indexed rejection (Decision 25): operating on a 3D
#       `tracers_raw` state raises `ArgumentError` pointing at
#       Plan 18b.
#
# Tier B (paper / hand-expansion) — required, always run:
#   B1. Two-term tendency formula applied to a hand-built 3-layer
#       column matches closed-form expected output.
#   B2. DTRAIN-missing Tiedtke fallback: forcing.dtrain === nothing
#       path runs and differs from the full CMFMC+DTRAIN path in the
#       documented way (compensating-subsidence-only).
#   B3. Cloud-base detection: the lowest-`k` interface with cmfmc
#       above tiny threshold is correctly identified; no action in
#       columns without any cmfmc.
#   B4. CFL-cache invalidation: `invalidate_cmfmc_cache!` resets the
#       `cache_valid` sentinel so the next apply! re-scans.
#   B5. n_sub safety ceiling: pathological unit-mismatch forcing
#       raises a clear error rather than hanging.
#
# Tier C (upstream cross-implementation) — opt-in via environment,
#   gated by `ATMOSTR_TIER_C_REFS`:
#   C1. Standard deep-tropical-convective column vs GCHP reference —
#       harness in repo; reference data fetched from
#       $ATMOSTR_TIER_C_REFS. Skipped at CI by default.
