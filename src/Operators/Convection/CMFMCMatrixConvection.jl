# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CMFMCMatrixConvection — GEOS-derived rates (cmfmc, dtrain) routed through
# the TM5 backward-Euler LU solver.
#
# Motivation
#
# The GCHP-audited "two-pass on the env reservoir + qc cloud reservoir"
# CMFMC update (our `CMFMCConvection`) is not column-conservative under
# our state variables when run in isolation. GCHP itself relies on a
# dynamics-core PBL air-mass rescale that lives outside this operator.
# Our kernel also intentionally diverges from line-by-line GCHP in two
# places (cloud-base proxied from cmfmc rather than DQRCU, plus an added
# Pass-0 cloud-base mass-closure update for column self-consistency), so
# the label is "GCHP-audited" not "GCHP-faithful". Empirically, on the
# C180/L72 4-tracer convection-only experiment, this kernel drifts
# `Σ tracer_mass` by ~1–10% per 3-day run.
#
# This operator preserves `Σ tracer_mass` to roundoff for inert tracers by
# (a) deriving non-negative entrainment/detrainment rates from the GEOS
# binary's `cmfmc/dtrain` and (b) solving the resulting backward-Euler
# matrix LU — the same conservative core used by `TM5Convection`. The
# matrix is column-stochastic by the `Σ entu = Σ detu` closure that the
# derivation kernels enforce defensively per column.
#
# It is NOT GCHP RAS numerics — it is GEOS-derived rates through TM5
# transport numerics. Use it where the conservation contract is required
# (4D-Var inversion adjoint, long integrations) and use `CMFMCConvection`
# for parity comparison.

GEOS-derived rates through the TM5 LU solver. The kwarg-tuned knobs all
pass through to the inner [`TM5Convection`](@ref) that performs the
column solve — see its docstring for `tile_workspace_gib`,
`use_collab_lu`, `lmax_conv`, and `n_merge` semantics.

# Forcing requirements

`forcing.cmfmc` and `forcing.dtrain` must be populated on the GEOS binary's
basis (whatever `state.air_mass` is — `dry` for our production runtime).
`forcing.tm5_fields` is ignored. The operator runs once-per-met-window
derivation to convert `(cmfmc, dtrain) → (entu, detu, 0, 0)`, caching the
result in [`CMFMCMatrixWorkspace`](@ref) for reuse across all substeps.

# Conservation contract

`Σ(m·q)` is preserved to floating-point roundoff for any inert tracer:
the TM5 LU matrix is column-stochastic once `Σ entu = Σ detu`, which the
derivation kernels guarantee by absorbing any boundary-residual at the
surface layer.

# Adjoint

The derivation is constant in the state vector — it depends only on
forcings — so the state-space adjoint is exactly the inner TM5 LU adjoint
applied to the cached derived rates. See `Adjoints/ConvectionAdjoint.jl`.

Per-sim pre-allocated workspace for [`CMFMCMatrixConvection`](@ref).

# Fields

- `tm5_workspace :: TS` — the underlying [`TM5Workspace`](@ref) carrying
  the column-tile matrix slab, pivots, and TM5 cell-area metrics.
- `derived_entu :: EU` — derived updraft entrainment rate, same shape and
  basis as `forcing.dtrain` (LL: `(Nx,Ny,Nz)`, RG: `(ncells,Nz)`, CS:
  `NTuple{6, (Nc,Nc,Nz)}`). Refreshed on every met-window advance via
  [`invalidate_cmfmc_matrix_cache!`](@ref); reused bit-exact across all
  substeps within a window.
- `derived_detu :: EU` — derived updraft detrainment rate, same shape as
  `derived_entu`. Includes the explicit GEOS `dtrain` plus any
  negative-entrainment residual folded in to keep `entu ≥ 0`.
- `zero_entd :: ED` — immutable zeros, same shape as `derived_entu`.
  Passed as the TM5 downdraft entrainment field (CMFMC has no downdraft
  in our binary contract).
- `zero_detd :: ED` — immutable zeros, same shape (TM5 downdraft
  detrainment).
- `derived_valid :: V` — `Base.RefValue{Bool}` flagging whether the
  cached derivation matches the current met window. Cleared via
  [`invalidate_cmfmc_matrix_cache!`](@ref) on window advance.

# Lifecycle

The derived rates are computed once per met-window from
`forcing.cmfmc + forcing.dtrain` by `_launch_cmfmc_matrix_derivation!`
(see `cmfmc_matrix_kernels.jl`). Within a window, `apply!` reuses the
cached arrays directly — the LU solve sees the same `(entu, detu, 0, 0)`
quadruplet every substep.

the convective fluxes share).

`halo_width` is the per-panel halo half-width `Hp` for cubed-sphere
