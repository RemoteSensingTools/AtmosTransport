    StepwiseField{FT, N, A, B, W}(samples, boundaries, current_window)

A rank-`N` `AbstractTimeVaryingField{FT, N}` that is **piecewise-constant
in time**. Stores a sequence of `N_win` spatial snapshots plus
`N_win + 1` window boundaries. `field_value` reads from the snapshot for
the window containing the current time; `update_field!(f, t)` binary-
searches the boundaries and caches the index of the current window.

Designed for CATRINE-style emission inventories that arrive as window-
averaged values (monthly, annual, weekly). The sample for window `n` is
the average value over `[boundaries[n], boundaries[n+1])`.

# Layout

```
samples     :: AbstractArray{FT, N + 1}   # rank N + 1
                                          # last dim iterates over windows
                                          # size(samples)[1:N] = spatial shape
                                          # size(samples, N+1) = N_win
boundaries  :: AbstractVector{<:Real}     # length N_win + 1, sorted
                                          # boundaries[n], boundaries[n+1]
                                          # bound window n
current_window :: AbstractVector{Int}     # length 1, holds the index that
                                          # `field_value` reads
```

The spatial prefix of `samples` matches the field's rank: rank-2 field →
`samples::AbstractArray{FT, 3}` with shape `(Nx, Ny, N_win)`. Rank-3 field
→ `samples::AbstractArray{FT, 4}` with `(Nx, Ny, Nz, N_win)`.

# Why `current_window` is a 1-element array

`Base.RefValue{Int}` would be the idiomatic mutable Int cache, but it is
not kernel-safe on GPU — a `Ref` dereference inside a KA kernel pulls from
host memory. Storing the index in a 1-element array lets `Adapt.adapt`
convert it to device storage alongside `samples`, so the kernel reads
`current_window[1]` as a device-local memory access. Overhead: one extra
device load per field_value call, broadcast across all kernel threads
(same value for every thread), effectively free.

# Kernel-safety

After `update_field!(f, t)` has been called by the operator, the kernel
can call `field_value(f, idx)` freely. The call is allocation-free and
type-stable. The operator is responsible for calling `update_field!` on
the host before launching the kernel, per
[TimeVaryingField §7](../../../docs/plans/TIME_VARYING_FIELD_MODEL.md).

# Out-of-bounds time

`update_field!(f, t)` with `t < boundaries[1]` or
`t >= boundaries[end]` throws an `ArgumentError`. This is stricter than
clamping but avoids silently extrapolating the first/last window — which
would bias emission totals. Callers that need cyclic coverage can wrap
in a `CyclicField` (future plan) or extend `boundaries` explicitly.

# Examples

```julia
# Rank-2 (surface) StepwiseField: monthly CO2 emission inventory
# over 12 months, Nx × Ny = 144 × 72.
samples    = rand(144, 72, 12)                        # kg/s per cell
boundaries = [FT(m * 30 * 86400) for m in 0:12]       # month starts, seconds
f          = StepwiseField(samples, boundaries)

update_field!(f, 15.0 * 86400)   # day 15 → window 1
field_value(f, (10, 20))         # = samples[10, 20, 1]

update_field!(f, 65.0 * 86400)   # day 65 → window 3
field_value(f, (10, 20))         # = samples[10, 20, 3]
```

# Adapt / GPU

```julia
using CUDA, Adapt
f_gpu = Adapt.adapt(CuArray, f)
# f_gpu.samples isa CuArray{FT, 3}
# f_gpu.current_window isa CuArray{Int, 1}
# field_value(f_gpu, (i, j)) now kernel-safe on GPU
