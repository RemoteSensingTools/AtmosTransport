# Memory-mapped, on-disk cubed-sphere tape storage policy.
#
# `MmapCSTapeStorage` is a sibling of `DeviceCSTapeStorage` and
# `PinnedHostCSTapeStorage` that evicts staged
# panel snapshots from working memory onto a raw appended binary file
# (`records.bin`). A separate human-readable manifest (`manifest.toml`)
# is written at finalisation time and used during resume / inspection.

#   tape/<run-id>/
#   ├── manifest.toml      # written on finalize_tape!
#   └── records.bin        # grown via truncate as slots are allocated
#
# Each slot reserves a contiguous span of `records.bin` and holds six
# `(record_id, panel_offset, panel_shape)` triplets. `stage_panels!`
# copies the source panels into `Mmap.mmap` views over the reserved
# region; `_tape_panels` returns mmap views (CPU runs) or copies them
# into a shared device-side cache (GPU runs, see CUDA extension).

Tape storage policy that streams staged adjoint mass states onto a
single appended raw binary file (`records.bin`) inside `dir` and emits a
TOML manifest (`manifest.toml`) at finalisation. `dir` is created if it
does not exist; if omitted, a unique temporary directory is created and
deleted when the storage object is garbage-collected.

The policy is backend-agnostic: CPU source panels yield in-place
`Mmap.mmap` views at read time; GPU source panels go through a shared
per-shape device-side read cache. The cache is keyed by the panel
shape signature (`NTuple{6, NTuple{3, Int}}`) so a reverse loop that
alternates between m-shaped (Nx,Nx,Nz), am-shaped (Nx+1,Nx,Nz),
bm-shaped (Nx,Nx+1,Nz), and cm-shaped (Nx,Nx,Nz+1) slots reuses each
shape's cache instead of reallocating six `similar(panel)` device
buffers on every read.

The on-disk format is the `manifest.toml` metadata plus appended raw
panel payloads in `records.bin`.

An empty `subdir` (the default) is used by the single-tape

Hook called once per slot allocation, **before** the disk reservation,

The **default** method assumes the source panels are non-`Array`

backend-matched read cache via `_ensure_tape_read_cache!`. The
specialised method for `NTuple{6, <:Array}` is a no-op so the CPU read
path can return mmap views directly without an intermediate copy.

The CUDA extension layers a `synchronize = CUDA.synchronize` hook on top
of the default to amortise asynchronous device transfers; correctness

Sync any pending mmap state, write the TOML manifest, and close the

`cleanup_on_finalize` is true, the directory is also removed after
manifest emission.

close, or temp-dir cleanup are caught and surfaced via `@warn` (or
suppressed if `quiet = true`). This matches the temp-dir use case
where leaving a partially-finalised storage behind is benign — the
directory gets cleaned up by GC or by the caller's `mktempdir do`
block anyway.

With `strict = true`, manifest- and close-failures are still caught
into local error slots (so the IO handle and device cache are released
before throwing), but the first such error is rethrown at the end of
the function. This is the right setting whenever the storage is rooted
at a caller-supplied `tape_path` and a missing/corrupt `manifest.toml`

    load_mmap_tape(dir; readonly = true) -> MmapCSTapeStorage

Reopen a finalised `MmapCSTapeStorage` directory written by an earlier
session. The loader parses `manifest.toml`, validates the format
version and machine endianness, and rebuilds the in-memory record
table so callers can fetch slots via [`get_record`](@ref) and read
them through `_tape_panels`.

The returned storage has `finalised = true` and `cleanup_on_finalize
= false`; it never touches the on-disk files except through mmap reads
on the existing slots. With `readonly = true` (the default)
`_bump_cursor!`, `_allocate_tape_slot`, and `stage_panels!` throw on
mutation; `readonly = false` opens the binary in `r+` mode but is
intended for future Phase B work (slot reuse), not for forward
appends — appends are blocked by the `finalised` flag.

Validation:

* `manifest.toml` and `records.bin` must both exist under `dir`.
* Format version must equal `$(_MMAP_TAPE_FORMAT_VERSION)`.
* Endianness must match the loading machine.
* `meta.finalised` must be `true`; a torn tape from an interrupted
  run is rejected here (Phase B is responsible for repairing it).
* `records.bin` must be at least `meta.total_bytes` long; the cursor
  is restored from `meta.total_bytes`.
