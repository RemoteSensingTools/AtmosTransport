# Plan 26 stretch — synthetic 4D-Var truth-recovery regression test.
#
# Loads `scripts/inversions/synthetic_experiment.jl`, runs the
# truth-emission → forward → noisy-obs → invert pipeline once with a
# deterministic seed, and asserts the inversion recovers the truth
# field within bounds.
#
# Acceptance bands (regression-grade, not science-grade):
#   - Cost reduction:        final / initial < 0.05
#                            (>20× reduction over the 15-iteration
#                            budget).
#   - Peak ratio:            recovered_peak / truth_peak in
#                            (0.5, 1.5) — the truth's central cell
#                            should be reconstructed within a factor
#                            of 2.
#   - Relative L2 error:     <= 0.5 — the recovered field is
#                            within 50% of the truth in L2 norm
#                            (the prior pulls cells far from the
#                            obs patch toward zero, contributing to
#                            this number).
